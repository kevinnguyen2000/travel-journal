      "The Statue of Liberty is covered with a layer of copper that is very thin – about the depth of two pennies pressed together. When she was assembled on Bedloe’s Island, she was a beautiful brown color, and stayed this way for around 35 years. By 1920, the copper skin had begun to oxidize and turn the lovely sea green we know today.",
